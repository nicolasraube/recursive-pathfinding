# Recursive Pathfinding
Recursively finding commands that will lead the player to the destination.
On the way there is water and blocks that can be picked up and placed down by the player. The player cannot walk forwards if the height difference to the next position is greater than one block.
The program will find the shortest sequence of commands necessary to reach the destination.
